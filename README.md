# brainfuck_examples
My adventures in the turing tarpit. So far a single small program that can
calculate a factorial if the result is small enough to fit into a byte of data
or more if your interpreter/compiler supports larger values.

factorial.bf is extremely verbosely commented in a style that resembles literate
programming. I did this so I can make sense of it later myself.
